# Day 2 DSA Practice — Lists, Tuples, Strings, Slicing

Today I focused on strengthening my **Python DSA fundamentals**. I practiced **lists, tuples, and strings**, along with **slicing and basic string problems**, improving my **problem-solving skills, loops, and logic building**.

---

## 1️⃣ Lists

- **Sum of list elements**: Compute sum manually using a loop  
- **Count even and odd numbers**: Count elements based on parity  
- **Find largest element**: Without using `max()`  
- **Reverse a list**: Without `reverse()` or slicing `[::-1]`  
- **Remove duplicates**: Keep original order, no `set()`  
- **Rotate list right by 1**: Move last element to first  
- **Second largest element**: Single pass, no sort or `max()` twice  
- **Merge two lists & remove duplicates**: Maintain order  
- **Frequency of elements**: Count occurrences using nested loops  

---

## 2️⃣ Tuples

- **Tuples**: Practiced logic for accessing elements, counting occurrences, indexing, and conversion to lists.

- **Access elements**: Loop through tuple to print items  
- **Count occurrence**: Count how many times an element appears  
- **Find index**: Find first occurrence of an element  
- **Tuple → List → Modify → Tuple**: Practice conversion and manipulation

## 3️⃣ Strings

- **Count vowels and consonants**: Ignore spaces, handle cases  
- **Palindrome check**: Case-insensitive check using slicing  
- **Reverse string**: Using slicing `[::-1]`  
- **First half & second half**: Split string by length  
- **Swap first & last characters**  
- **Replace vowels with `*`**  
- **Remove duplicate characters**: Keep first occurrence only  
- **Characters at even/odd index**  
- **Word count**: Count words in a sentence

## ✅ Key Skills Practiced

- Loops: `for` and `while`  
- Conditionals: `if/else`  
- List & tuple manipulation  
- String handling and slicing  
- Logic building for DSA  
- Problem-solving mindset

This practice covers **all fundamental operations with lists, tuples, and strings**, forming a strong foundation for **future DSA topics**.
