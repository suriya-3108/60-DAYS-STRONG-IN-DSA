# Day 6 DSA Practice — Easy Problems on Arrays & Strings

Today I focused on strengthening my **Python DSA fundamentals** by practicing **arrays (lists) and strings**, including basic operations, loops, frequency counting, and simple manipulations. This helped improve my **problem-solving skills, logic building, and preparing for in-place and iterative algorithms**.

---

## 1️⃣ Arrays / Lists

* **Second Largest Element** — Find the second largest number in a list using loops and comparison  
  *Example:* `[10, 20, 4, 45, 99]` → `45`

* **Move Zeros to End** — Reorder a list in-place so all zeros are moved to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements  
  *Example:* `[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]` → `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`

* **Sum of All Elements** — Calculate the sum of numbers in a list using a loop  
  *Example:* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` → `15`

* **Sum of Even Numbers** — Calculate the sum of only even numbers in a list  
  *Example:* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` → `12`

* **Find All Duplicates in a List** — Count frequency using dictionary and print elements occurring more than once  
  *Example:* `[1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 6, 6]` → `1, 3, 6`

## 2️⃣ Strings

* **Character Frequency in a String** — Count the occurrences of each character using a dictionary  
  *Example:* `"programming"` → `{'p': 1, 'r': 2, 'o': 1, 'g': 2, 'a': 1, 'm': 2, 'i': 1, 'n': 1}`

* **Check Anagram** — Compare frequency dictionaries of two strings to check if they are anagrams  
  *Example:* `"listen"` & `"silent"` → `True`

* **Longest Word in a List** — Find the longest word in a list of strings using loop and length comparison  
  *Example:* `["cat", "elephant", "dog", "hippopotamus", "rat"]` → `"hippopotamus"`

* **Count Vowels in List of Strings** — Iterate through each character in words to count vowels  
  *Example:* `["apple", "banana", "grape"]` → `8`

## 3️⃣ Combined / Logic Skills

* **Looping + Conditionals** — Applied nested loops for character and word-level operations  
* **In-Place Array Manipulation** — Practiced moving elements without extra space using pointers  
* **Frequency Counting** — Applied dictionaries to count numbers and characters  
* **Edge Case Thinking** — Considered empty lists, all zeros, repeated characters, and equal-length strings

## ✅ Key Skills Practiced

* **Lists & Arrays** — Iteration, indexing, in-place modification, sum calculations  
* **Strings** — Traversal, character frequency, vowel counting, longest word identification  
* **Dictionaries** — Frequency counting for arrays and strings  
* **Problem-Solving Patterns** — Nested loops, conditionals, order preservation, first occurrence handling  
* **Optimization Awareness** — Thinking about space (O(1)) and time (O(n)) efficiency

This practice covers **all fundamental operations with arrays and strings**, forming a strong foundation for **future DSA topics** like in-place algorithms, string manipulation problems, and frequency-based challenges.
