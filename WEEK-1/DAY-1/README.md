# Python DSA – Day 1

## Overview
Today is my **first day of DSA preparation using Python**.  
I focused on building a strong foundation in **Python basics**, loops, functions, and basic problem-solving, which are essential for tackling algorithm and data structure problems.

---

## Topics Covered
- Python **variables** and basic data types  
- **Loops**: `for` and `while`  
- **Conditional statements**: `if`, `elif`, `else`  
- **Functions**: defining, calling, and returning values  
- **Basic math operations** and logic  

---

## Problems Practiced

### 1. Numbers divisible by 3 and 5
- Print all numbers from 1 to N divisible by both 3 and 5.

### 2. Prime Number Check
- Create a function to check if a number is prime.

### 3. Second Largest Number
- Find the second largest number in a set of numbers using single-pass logic.

### 4. Reverse a Number
- Reverse a number without converting it to a string.

### 5. Factorial of a Number
- Compute factorial using recursion and also using loops.

### 6. Sum of Digits
- Calculate the sum of all digits of a number using loops and math operations.

### 7. Armstrong Number Check
- Check if a number equals the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

### 8. Fibonacci Sequence (N terms)
- Print the first N terms of the Fibonacci sequence using loops.

### 9. Sum of Even and Odd Digits
- Calculate sum of even digits and sum of odd digits of a number separately.

### 10. Count Number of Digits
- Count how many digits a number has using loops.  
- **Special case:** Leading zeros are counted when input is taken as a string.

## Key Learnings
- Loops and conditions are the **core foundation of DSA problems**.  
- Functions help **reuse logic** and keep code organized.  
- `%` and `//` are powerful for **digit-based number problems**.  
- Recursive thinking is important, but **iterative solutions are safer for beginners**.  
- Visualization of loop logic (Fibonacci, reverse number) improves problem-solving skills.  
- Handling **edge cases** like `0` or leading zeros is important for robust programs.
